Initial project.

These were the prompts used to generate:
* (Planning mode) I want to make a browser based 3d accelerated game that is based on the logic of space invaders, but instead of aliens invading earth, I want it to be aliens defending their own planet against earthlings. It would have the same gameplay mechanics as space invaders, but the player can collect powerups that are alien tech themed, to counteract the far larger number of earthlings invading.
* 4 questions asked:

  
Which 3D rendering approach would you like for the browser game?
Three.js
- Popular, well-documented WebGL library with large ecosystem
What visual style do you envision for the game?
Retro-modern hybrid
- 3D models with neon/pixel aesthetic, glowing grids — pays homage to the original
How many alien-tech powerup types would you like at launch? Pick the ones you want or describe your own.
~8-10 powerups
- Larger variety including combos and rare drops
What scope do you want for the initial version?
Modular project
- Separate files with a bundler (Vite/Webpack), npm dependencies

  
* Second prompt
(Switch into agent mode) Start implementation

* Third prompt
there's no indication of health for the player

* Fourth prompt
I'm not a big fan of the 3d perspective. Change it to a 2d perspective.

* Fifth prompt
I want an animated alien world in the background that has the sunlight rising like it does when earth is viewed from the international space station, but it should be an alien world instead.

* Sixth prompt with image
The bloom is far too high, and the alien planet is 100% glowing to the point of obscuring the player and the fire being exchanged

* Seventh prompt with image
why is the bloom around the sun a rectangle? Also, I want it rising above the planet from behind, like a cinematic sunrise from space with lensflare, not orbiting the planet from right to left
